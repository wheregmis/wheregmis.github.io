# Introduction
<br>

![Ferris the Rustacean](http://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-flat-happy.png)

Building web applications in Rust has never been more exciting. With Dioxus, we get the power of Rust's safety and performance combined with a React-like developer experience.
<br>

## Why Rust for Web Development?
<br>

* **Performance**: Lightning-fast runtime performance
* **Safety**: Memory safety without garbage collection
* **Modern Tooling**: Rich ecosystem and excellent developer experience

## Code Example

```rust
#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
    let count = use_signal(|| 0);
    
    rsx! {
        div {
            h1 { "Hello from Dioxus!" }
            button { 
                onclick: move |_| count += 1,
                "Clicks: {count}"
            }
        }
    }
} 
```
